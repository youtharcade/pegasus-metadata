// This is the main collection area, this is where you'll denote what console, rom extension, and emulator to use
// You can add as many extensions as you want by adding a comma but keep in mind the emulator has to support it
// When you launch the emulator - you can add arguments, but they have to go between the application and file path
collection: Playstation 2

extensions: iso
launch: /Applications/PCSX2-v1.7.2952.app {file.path} 

// This is where you add your games - Pegasus will find every game within the folder, however there will be no metadata.
// There's many different ways to get the metadata, I'm coding it by hand for the practice. You can use a scraper if you'd like.
// For more information on that aspect, you'll need to hit up the Pegasus website: https://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/meta-assets/
